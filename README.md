### Learning objectives
I learned several things from this container. For example I used FTP for the first time.Some elements were already known such as brute force and reading files. Although some elements were new such as the ZIP file password were I used binwalk. It was interesting to go in depth on getting information based on a picture. Transcibing a code into regular text(from BASE64) was familiar and I thought it was a fun concept. Afterwards I used Jack the ripper which was my first time.
# Glossary
<b>FTP </b><br>
-File Transfer Protocol
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of files from one host to another over a TCP-based network, such as the Internet. FTP works by opening two connections that link the computers trying to communicate with each other.

<b>Binwalk</b><br>
-Binwalk is a simple linux tool for analysing binary files for embeded files and executable code. It is mostly used to extract the content of firmware images.
